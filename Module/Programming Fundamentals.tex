\chapter{Introduction to Python}

\section{Introduction}

\textbf{Python} is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and
object-oriented scripting language. It is designed to be highly
readable, using English keywords frequently, unlike other languages
that use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions.

Python is a versatile, general-purpose, and powerful programming language.
It is an excellent first language because it is concise and easy to read.
Whether you want to do web development, machine learning, or data science,
Python is the language for you.

\subsection{History of Python}

Python was developed by \textbf{Guido van Rossum} in the late 80's
and early 90's at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and
Computer Science in the Netherlands. Python is derived from many other
languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and
Unix shell and other scripting languages.

\subsection{What is Programming Language?}

A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions
that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in
computer programming to implement algorithms.

\section{Environment Setup}

In software development, an \textbf{integrated development environment (IDE)}
is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer
programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source
code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Other than the IDE,
it is also important to have the programming language installed on your
computer.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Hello, World! Program}, label={lst:hello-world}]
    print("Hello, World!")
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item Click on the ``Run'' button to run the program.
    \item You should see the output ``Hello, World!'' displayed in the Run window.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Basic Syntax}

In Python, the syntax refers to the rules that define the combinations of
symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in the
language. The Python syntax is simple and easy to learn. It is based on
indentation and does not require the use of curly braces or semicolons.
It can also be easily understood by beginners as it is very similarly
structured to the English language.

\subsection{Variables}

A variable is a name that refers to a value. In Python, variables are
created when you assign a value to them. You can assign a value to a
variable using the assignment operator \texttt{=}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Variable Assignment}, label={lst:variables}]
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

print(x)
print(y)
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:variables} shows how to assign values to variables in Python.
In this example, the variable \texttt{x} is assigned the value 5, and the
variable \texttt{y} is assigned the value ``Hello, World!''.

\subsection{Python Identifiers}

An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc.
It helps to differentiate one entity from another. In Python, an identifier
is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other
object. An identifier must start with a letter or an underscore (\_),
followed by letters, digits, or underscores.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Valid and Invalid Identifiers}, label={lst:identifiers}]
# Valid Identifiers
my_variable = 5
myVariable = 10
_my_variable = 15

# Invalid Identifiers
1variable = 20
my-variable = 25
my variable = 30
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:identifiers} shows examples of valid and invalid identifiers
in Python. In this example, the variables \texttt{my\_variable},
\texttt{myVariable}, and \texttt{\_my\_variable} are valid identifiers,
while the variables \texttt{1variable}, \texttt{my-variable}, and
\texttt{my variable} are invalid identifiers.

\subsection{Reserved Words}

Python has a set of reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers.
These reserved words are used by the Python interpreter to recognize the
structure of the program. Some of the reserved words in Python include:

\begin{multicols}{4}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{False}
        \item \texttt{None}
        \item \texttt{True}
        \item \texttt{and}
        \item \texttt{as}
        \item \texttt{assert}
        \item \texttt{break}
        \item \texttt{class}
        \item \texttt{continue}
        \item \texttt{def}
        \item \texttt{del}
        \item \texttt{elif}
        \item \texttt{else}
        \item \texttt{except}
        \item \texttt{exec}
        \item \texttt{finally}
        \item \texttt{for}
        \item \texttt{from}
        \item \texttt{global}
        \item \texttt{if}
        \item \texttt{import}
        \item \texttt{in}
        \item \texttt{is}
        \item \texttt{lambda}
        \item \texttt{nonlocal}
        \item \texttt{not}
        \item \texttt{or}
        \item \texttt{pass}
        \item \texttt{print}
        \item \texttt{raise}
        \item \texttt{return}
        \item \texttt{try}
        \item \texttt{while}
        \item \texttt{with}
        \item \texttt{yield}
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

These reserved words cannot be used as identifiers in Python. They cannot
be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifier names.

\subsection{Quotation in Python}

In Python, you can use either single quotes (\texttt{'}), double quotes
(\texttt{"}), or triple quotes (\texttt{'''} or \texttt{"""}). Single and
double quotes are used to represent strings, while triple quotes are used
to represent multi-line strings.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Quotation in Python}, label={lst:quotation}]
single_quote = 'Hello, World!'
double_quote = "Hello, World!"
triple_quote = '''Hello,
World!'''

print(single_quote)
print(double_quote)
print(triple_quote)
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:quotation} shows examples of using single quotes, double
quotes, and triple quotes in Python. In this example, the variables
\texttt{single\_quote}, \texttt{double\_quote}, and \texttt{triple\_quote}
are assigned string values using single quotes, double quotes, and triple
quotes, respectively. A single quote or double quote can be used to
represent a string value, while triple quotes are used to represent
multi-line strings.

\subsubsection{Escape Characters}

An escape character is a backslash (\textbackslash) followed by a character
that has a special meaning in Python. It is used to represent characters
that are difficult or impossible to type directly. Some of the common
escape characters in Python include:

\begin{multicols}{3}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash n} - New Line
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash t} - Tab
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash r} - Carriage Return
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash \textbackslash} - Backslash
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash '} - Single Quote
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash "} - Double Quote
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash b} - Backspace
        \item \texttt{\textbackslash f} - Form Feed
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

These escape characters are used to represent special characters in Python.
For example, the escape character \texttt{\textbackslash n} is used to
represent a newline character, while the escape character \texttt{\textbackslash t}
is used to represent a tab character.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Escape Characters in Python}, label={lst:escape}]
new_line = "Hello,\nWorld!"
tab_space = "Hello,\tWorld!"
carriage_return = "Hello,\rWorld!"
back_slash = "Hello,\\World!"
single_quote = "Hello,\'World!"
double_quote = "Hello,\"World!"
back_space = "Hello,\bWorld!"
form_feed = "Hello,\fWorld!"

print(new_line)
print(tab_space)
print(carriage_return)
print(back_slash)
print(single_quote)
print(double_quote)
print(back_space)
print(form_feed)
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:escape} shows examples of using escape characters in Python.
In this example, the variables \texttt{new\_line}, \texttt{tab\_space},
\texttt{back\_slash}, \texttt{single\_quote}, \texttt{double\_quote},
\texttt{back\_space}, and \texttt{form\_feed} are assigned string values
using escape characters to represent special characters.

\subsubsection{Multi-line Strings in Single or Double Quotes}

In Python, you can use triple quotes (\texttt{'''} or \texttt{"""}) to
represent multi-line strings. This allows you to write strings that span
multiple lines without using escape characters. However, if you want to
represent multi-line strings using single or double quotes, you can use
the escape character \texttt{\textbackslash n} to represent a newline
character.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Multi-line Strings in Single or Double Quotes}, label={lst:multi-line}]
multi_line_single = 'Hello,\nWorld!'
multi_line_double = "Hello,\nWorld!"

print(multi_line_single)
print(multi_line_double)
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:multi-line} shows examples of using multi-line strings in
single or double quotes in Python. In this example, the variables
\texttt{multi\_line\_single} and \texttt{multi\_line\_double} are assigned
string values using the escape character \texttt{\textbackslash n} to
represent a newline character.

\subsection{Comments}

Comments are used to explain the code and make it more readable. In Python,
comments start with the hash character (\texttt{\#}) and continue to the
end of the line. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are
not executed as part of the program.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Comments in Python}, label={lst:comments}]
# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
'''

"""
This is also a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
"""
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:comments} shows examples of single-line and multi-line
comments in Python. In this example, the single-line comment starts with
the hash character (\texttt{\#}), while the multi-line comment is enclosed
in triple quotes (\texttt{'''} or \texttt{"""}).

\subsection{Lines and Indentation}

Python uses indentation to define the structure of the code. Indentation
is used to group statements together. The number of spaces in the
indentation is not fixed, but all statements within the block must be
indented the same amount.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Lines and Indentation in Python}, label={lst:indentation}]
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:indentation} shows an example of using indentation in Python.
In this example, the \texttt{print()} statement is indented to indicate
that it is part of the \texttt{if} block. The number of spaces in the
indentation is not fixed, but all statements within the block must be
indented the same amount.

\subsection{Multi-Line Statements}

In Python, a statement can span multiple lines if it is enclosed in
parentheses \texttt{()}, square brackets \texttt{[]}, or curly braces
\texttt{\{\}}. This is useful when you have a long statement that you
want to split into multiple lines for readability.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Multi-Line Statements in Python}, label={lst:multiline}]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
           6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

total = (1 + 2 + 3 +
            4 + 5 + 6 +
            7 + 8 + 9 + 10)

colors = {'red': 255, 'green': 255,
            'blue': 255}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:multiline} shows examples of using multi-line statements in
Python. In this example, the list \texttt{numbers}, the sum \texttt{total},
and the dictionary \texttt{colors} are defined using multi-line statements
enclosed in square brackets, parentheses, and curly braces, respectively.

\subsection{Data Types}

In Python, every value has a data type. Data types are used to represent
different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries,
etc. These data types are used to store, manipulate, and represent data in
Python programs. Say for example, the data type \texttt{int} is used to
represent integers, the data type \texttt{float} is used to represent
floating-point numbers, and the data type \texttt{str} is used to represent
strings. Using the correct data type is important because it determines
how the data is stored and how it can be manipulated.

\subsubsection{Integers}

Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. In Python, integers
are represented using the \texttt{int} data type. Integers can be positive
or negative, and they can be used in mathematical operations such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Integers in Python}, label={lst:integers}]
x = 5
y = -10

print(x)
print(y)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:integers} shows examples of using integers in Python. In this
example, the variables \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are assigned integer values
5 and -10, respectively. The \texttt{print()} function is used to display
the values of the variables, and the \texttt{type()} function is used to
display the data type of the variables. An integer is best used when you
need to represent whole numbers without any decimal points like counting
the number of students in a class or the number of books in a library.

\subsubsection{Floats}

\textbf{Floats} are decimal numbers, such as 1.0, 2.5, 3.14, 4.0, etc. In
Python, floats are represented using the \texttt{float} data type. Floats
can be used to represent real numbers, and they can be used in mathematical
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Floats in Python}, label={lst:floats}]
x = 3.14
y = -2.5

print(x)
print(y)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:floats} shows examples of using floats in Python. In this
example, the variables \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are assigned float values
3.14 and -2.5, respectively. A float is best used when
you need to represent real numbers with decimal points like the price of
an item or the temperature of a place.

\subsubsection{Strings}

Strings are sequences of characters, such as ``Hello, World!'', ``Python'',
``Programming'', etc. In Python, strings are represented using the \texttt{str}
data type. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes (\texttt{'}), double
quotes (\texttt{"}), or triple quotes (\texttt{'''} or \texttt{"""}).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Strings in Python}, label={lst:strings}]
x = "Hello, World!"
y = 'Python'

print(x)
print(y)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:strings} shows examples of using strings in Python. In this
example, the variables \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are assigned string values
``Hello, World!'' and ``Python'', respectively. A string is best used when
you need to represent text data like names, addresses, or messages.

\subsubsection{Lists}

A list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. In Python,
lists are represented using the \texttt{list} data type. Lists can contain
items of different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, etc. Lists
are enclosed in square brackets \texttt{[]} and the items are separated by
commas.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Lists in Python}, label={lst:lists}]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

print(numbers)
print(fruits)

print(type(numbers))
print(type(fruits))
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:lists} shows examples of using lists in Python.
In this example, the variables \texttt{numbers} and \texttt{fruits} are
assigned list values \texttt{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]} and \texttt{['apple',
'banana', 'cherry']}, respectively. A list is best used when you need to
store multiple items in a single variable that can be changed like a list
of numbers or a list of names.

\subsubsection{Tuples}

A tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and unchangeable. In
Python, tuples are represented using the \texttt{tuple} data type. Tuples
can contain items of different data types, such as integers, floats,
strings, etc. Tuples are enclosed in parentheses \texttt{()} and the
items are separated by commas.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Tuples in Python}, label={lst:tuples}]
coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')

print(coordinates)
print(colors)

print(type(coordinates))
print(type(colors))
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:tuples} shows examples of using tuples in Python.
In this example, the variables \texttt{coordinates} and \texttt{colors}
are assigned tuple values \texttt{(1, 2, 3)} and \texttt{('red', 'green',
'blue')}, respectively. A tuple is best used when you need to store
multiple items in a single variable that should not be changed like the
coordinates of a point or the RGB values of a color.

\subsubsection{Dictionary}

A dictionary is a collection of items that are unordered, changeable, and
indexed. In Python, dictionaries are represented using the \texttt{dict}
data type. Dictionaries consist of key-value pairs, where each key is
associated with a value. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces
\texttt{\{\}} and the key-value pairs are separated by commas.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={Dictionaries in Python}, label={lst:dictionaries}]
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
colors = {'red': 255, 'green': 255, 'blue': 255}

print(person)
print(colors)

print(type(person))
print(type(colors))
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:dictionaries} shows examples of using dictionaries in Python.
In this example, the variables \texttt{person} and \texttt{colors} are
assigned dictionary values \texttt{\{'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city':
'New York'\}} and \texttt{\{'red': 255, 'green': 255, 'blue': 255\}},
respectively. A dictionary is best used when you need to store key-value
pairs like the details of a person or the RGB values of a color.
